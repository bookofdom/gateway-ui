// This file imports the preferred app.sass entry-point.
//
// TODO
// This file depends on a forked version of `ember-cli-compass-compiler`.  When
// the fork is merged into the main project, `package.json` should be updated to
// refer to the main project.  Hopefully, `app.sass` entry-points will also be
// supported at that time.  See:
// https://github.com/quaertym/ember-cli-compass-compiler/pull/38
